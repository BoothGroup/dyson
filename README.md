# `dyson`: Dyson equation solvers for Green's function methods

[![CI](https://github.com/BoothGroup/dyson/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BoothGroup/dyson/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)  

The `dyson` package implements various Dyson equation solvers, including novel approaches that avoiding explicitly grid-resolved numerical procedures such as Fourier transforms and analytical continuation.
These include the moment-resolved block Lanczos methods for moments of the Green's function or self-energy.

## Installation

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BoothGroup/dyson
pip install .
```

## Usage

Examples are available in the `examples` directory.
