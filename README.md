# dyson: Dyson equation solvers for electron propagator methods

The `dyson` package implements various Dyson equation solvers, with a focus on those avoiding explicitly grid-resolved numerical procedures such as Fourier transforms and analytical continutation.
These include the moment-resolved block Lanczos methods for moments of the Green's function or self-energy.

### Installation:

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BoothGroup/dyson
pip install .
```

### Usage

Examples are available in the `examples` directory.
